As the DBA I installed and configured several Oracle 8i databases, both the servers and the clients.  I used PL/SQL for both triggers and stored procedures.   I also modified the database schema and configuration to improve efficiency.\nOn this project I developed: \u2022 a Web-based utility to enable staff administrators to maintain database data\n\u2022 a Web-based utility to enable instructors to maintain class data\n\u2022 a Web-based utility to generate statistical data for project analysis\n\u2022 an install procedure for the entire product as well as the documentation for it\nDuring my tenure at EnterTech I took a half-dozen technical courses in the Oracle DBA track and received Oracle certification as a DBA (an OCP).",

I have experience forming new teams to implement products/features from the ground up, as well as leading pre-existing teams to improve process and productivity and deliver significant new versions.\n\nI am currently the Engineering Director for Jobseeker Applications at Indeed, working every day on consumer-facing web applications that scale to many millions of users. I have led the Job Search development team since April 2009 and the newer Resume team since its formation in December 2010. Our job search sites worldwide have over 90 million unique visitors who do over 3 billion job searches each month, and millions of jobseekers worldwide have created an Indeed Resume since our launch in March 2011.\n\nPrevious to Indeed, I was a Tech Lead/Manager at Google in the New York and Santa Monica offices, leading AdWords projects.

Responsible for implementing core infrastructure components critical to the successful transition. Experience with advanced .NET MVC3 topics like dependency injection, custom model binding and custom action filters.\n\n* Contributed to the design and implementation of our core UI widget infrastructure serving as the foundation for all our .NET MVC3 pages. Leveraged the YUI3 loader to dynamically load (CSS/JS dependencies) and render widgets on the fly based on their JSON representations. Developed custom scaffolder based on the MvcScaffolding project so that developers could easily generate new UI widgets.\n\n* Developed a MVC3 framework that allowed developers to quickly setup and implement a linear, wizard-like workflow based on MVC controllers and actions.\n\n* Lead the redesign of the settings interfaces for a core APT product. Collaborated with product management, a UX designer and end users when creating initial mockups, building prototypes and tweaking the final implementation. Client users praised the new interface as being \u201cclean\u201d and \u201ceasier to use\u201d.\n\n* Developed and advocated internal tools that increased developer productivity and coding standards. Improved our source-control and bug tracking integration and developed Visual Studio snippets to facilitate easy YUIDoc JavaScript documentation (increased adoption 10x).\n\n* Active participate in the recruiting process: identified and reached out to top candidates, presented at on-campus events and conducted on-campus and final round interviews.",

The generated values were key to the linear regression modeling process, a crucial component in the Network Planner and Test and Learn for Sites products. \n\t* Maintained a suite of unit-tests critical to facilitating a partial rewrite that improved performance by 10x.\n\n* Developed a tile server using SharpMap responsible for rendering tiles for all maps used in APT\u2019s software. Combined point icons, boundary outlines and GIS regions shaded based on demographic data or financial performances of stores in that region. Helped identify, debug and fix performance issues in the rendering process.\n\n* Developed a custom Salesforce application using Apex and VisualForce used by the sales and marketing teams. Iterated closely with the SVP of sales and SVP of marketing to understand the sales & marketing processes and how different tools would increase each team\u2019s productivity.\n\t* Built a system to track responses to marketing campaigns.
